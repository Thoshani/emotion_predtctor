📌 Project Title
Emotion-Aware Feedback Analyzer & Mentoring Chat System

📄 Project Description
This project is an AI-powered feedback analyzer that uses text sentiment analysis and emotion classification to detect the emotional tone of user messages in real-time. It helps mentors, educators, and support agents better understand users’ feelings — such as sadness, happiness, anger, dullness, or annoyance — based on the text they write.

🎯 Goal
The goal is to build an emotion-aware chat or feedback system that:

Analyzes messages automatically.

Identifies the emotion behind each message.

Supports better responses, mentoring, or automated suggestions.

🔍 Dataset
The system uses a labeled dataset of user messages:

Messages: Short text inputs (e.g., “I feel lost”, “I’m happy today!”).

Labels: Emotions like sad, happy, angry, dull, annoyed.

The dataset is preprocessed using TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.

⚙️ Technologies & Methods
Text Preprocessing: Cleaning, lowercasing, removing stopwords.

Feature Engineering: TF-IDF vectorization.

Models Used:

Logistic Regression: A baseline shallow classifier.

RNN/LSTM: (Optional) Deep learning model for better context understanding.

Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

✅ Expected Outcome
A working Feedback Analyzer that:

Takes a message as input.

Predicts the emotion label.

Can be integrated into chatbots, mentoring tools, or feedback dashboards.

🚀 How to Use
Train the Model
Run the Python script to preprocess the dataset, train the model, and evaluate it.

Make Predictions
Use the trained model to predict emotions for new text messages.

Deploy (Optional)
Integrate it into a web app using Flask or Streamlit for real-time feedback analysis.
